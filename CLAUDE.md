# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a League of Legends "Prodle" game - a Wordle-style guessing game for League of Legends esports players. Players guess professional players based on various attributes like team, league, role, country, age, and statistics. The game features a sophisticated scoring system, session management, leaderboard functionality, and a complete web interface.

## Development Commands

```bash
# Initialize dependencies
go mod tidy

# Run the application
go run .

# Build the application
go build

# Format code
go fmt ./...

# Check for issues
go vet

# Run tests (when they exist)
go test ./...
```

## Architecture Overview

The project follows a clean architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns:
- **Backend**: Go with HTTP server, SQLite database, and RESTful APIs
- **Frontend**: HTML templates with vanilla JavaScript for game logic
- **Data**: JSON data files with 3000+ LoL esports players
- **Assets**: Team logos, custom fonts, and background images

### Comparison Logic System
- **Exact Match** (Green): All attributes match perfectly
- **Partial Match** (Yellow): 
  - Team: Same league, different team
  - Country: Same continent, different country
- **Higher/Lower** (Arrows): Age, KDA ratio, number of clubs, statistical averages
- **Wrong** (Gray): No match
